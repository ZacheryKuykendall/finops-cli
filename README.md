# FinOps Multi-Cloud Python Library

## Overview

This Python library is designed to empower FinOps engineers to manage and optimize cloud spending across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. It provides real-time cost analysis by querying each cloudâ€™s billing APIs, normalizes the data into a common format, and lays the groundwork for future automation features such as anomaly detection, AI/ML-powered forecasting, and policy enforcement.

## Key FinOps Principles

- **Cost Visibility & Timeliness:** Immediate access to up-to-date cost data.
- **Accountability:** Empowering teams to monitor and own their cloud spending.
- **Collaboration:** Encouraging cross-functional teamwork between finance, engineering, and operations.
- **Centralized Governance:** Consolidating cost management and enforcing policies across clouds.
- **Optimization & Automation:** Continuously identifying and acting on cost-saving opportunities.

## High-Level Goals

- Provide a unified multi-cloud view of costs via real-time API queries.
- Offer modular design to support future enhancements such as automation, anomaly detection, and forecasting.
- Enable FinOps engineers to work via a command-line interface (CLI) with a moderate learning curve.
