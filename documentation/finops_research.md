Got it! I will conduct deep research into cost efficiency criteria using sources from finops.org (including FOCUS and FinOps Certified Practitioner and Professional study guides), as well as AWS, GCP, and Azure's FinOps guidelines and principles. Based on this research, I will create a structured set of standards for evaluating cost efficiency, including cloud-specific and cloud-agnostic metrics. Additionally, I will analyze if weightings or priorities are recommended and incorporate them accordingly.

I'll let you know once I have a detailed breakdown ready for review.

# Cost Efficiency Scoring Criteria for FinOps CLI

## Key Cost Efficiency Metrics (FinOps KPI’s)  
**Cloud cost efficiency** is typically measured by a set of core metrics that apply across cloud providers. These FinOps key performance indicators (KPIs) help quantify how well resources are utilized and costs are optimized. Important metrics include:

- **Resource Utilization Rate** – The percentage of provisioned cloud resources actually in use. Low utilization indicates overprovisioning. For example, if a VM is only 10% utilized on average, it’s a candidate for rightsizing or consolidation ([6 FinOps KPIs and metrics to optimize cloud expenditures | TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tip/FinOps-KPIs-and-metrics-to-optimize-cloud-expenditures#:~:text=1)). High utilization (without performance issues) signifies efficient use of what you’re paying for. This metric highlights opportunities to **right-size** instances or eliminate idle capacity to improve ROI ([6 FinOps KPIs and metrics to optimize cloud expenditures | TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tip/FinOps-KPIs-and-metrics-to-optimize-cloud-expenditures#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%20company%20that,reduction%20in%20AWS%20spending)).

- **Percentage of Cloud Waste** – The share of cloud spend attributed to idle or unused resources. This includes forgotten running instances, orphaned storage volumes, and underused services. Industry estimates show nearly **30% of cloud spend is wasted** on such idle resources ([6 FinOps KPIs and metrics to optimize cloud expenditures | TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tip/FinOps-KPIs-and-metrics-to-optimize-cloud-expenditures#:~:text=claw%20back%20the%20savings)). In fact, a 2024 FinOps Foundation survey found **“reducing waste” to be the #1 priority** for FinOps teams ([Reducing Waste and Managing Commitments Top Key Priorities for FinOps Practitioners ](https://www.finops.org/insights/key-priorities-shift-in-2024/#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20time%2C%20Reducing,getting%20from%20their%20cloud%20investments)). Tracking waste percentage helps drive efforts like shutting down unused assets and scheduling resources off-hours. The goal is to continually **reduce waste** and reinvest those savings.

- **Cost Allocation Rate** – The proportion of cloud spend that is properly allocated (attributed) to a business unit, project, or owner. FinOps emphasizes full cost accountability; **unallocated (or “shared”/unknown) costs should be minimized** ([6 FinOps KPIs and metrics to optimize cloud expenditures | TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tip/FinOps-KPIs-and-metrics-to-optimize-cloud-expenditures#:~:text=Organizations%20often%20struggle%20to%20interpret,cost%20centers%20and%20assign%20costs)). This metric is often expressed as the percentage of spend that *cannot* be traced to an owner (lower is better) ([6 FinOps KPIs and metrics to optimize cloud expenditures | TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tip/FinOps-KPIs-and-metrics-to-optimize-cloud-expenditures#:~:text=identify%20cost%20centers%20and%20assign,costs)). High allocation rates indicate strong tagging and showback practices, enabling teams to take action on their costs. As organizations scale, achieving near-100% allocation becomes challenging but remains critical (in FinOps Foundation data, **large spenders list full cost allocation as a top-3 priority** once basic optimization is in place ([Reducing Waste and Managing Commitments Top Key Priorities for FinOps Practitioners ](https://www.finops.org/insights/key-priorities-shift-in-2024/#:~:text=the%20second%20highest%20priorities,it%20gets%20out%20of%20hand))).

- **Unit Cost (Cost per Unit of Output)** – The cost of cloud per business-relevant unit, such as cost per customer, per transaction, per API call, etc. This is a **unit economics** approach to gauge efficiency ([Guidance for Cloud Financial Management on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/cloud-financial-management-on-aws/#:~:text=Business%20metrics%20measure%20efficiency%20related,or%20cost%20per%20shipped%20product)). By tracking *cost per unit*, companies can tell if they are getting more output for the same cost over time. For example, monitoring *cost per user* or *per order* should trend downward as efficiency improves. Unit cost KPIs tie cloud spend to business value and encourage optimization that doesn’t just cut cost, but increases the **output per dollar** ([Guidance for Cloud Financial Management on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/cloud-financial-management-on-aws/#:~:text=A%20good%20KPI%20measures%20efficiency,dollar%20spent%20for%20your%20organization)) ([Guidance for Cloud Financial Management on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/cloud-financial-management-on-aws/#:~:text=KPIs%20can%20be%20broken%20down,Month)). (IT-focused unit metrics can also be used, like cost per GB of storage or per vCPU-hour, to measure technical efficiency ([Guidance for Cloud Financial Management on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/cloud-financial-management-on-aws/#:~:text=KPIs%20can%20be%20broken%20down,Month)).)

- **Discount Coverage** – The percentage of cloud spend covered by **commitment-based discounts** (such as reserved instances, savings plans, committed use contracts, or sustained use discounts). Committed usage purchases offer significantly lower rates than on-demand (often 20–70% savings) ([6 FinOps KPIs and metrics to optimize cloud expenditures | TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tip/FinOps-KPIs-and-metrics-to-optimize-cloud-expenditures#:~:text=5,percentage%20of%20cloud%20spend)). This metric tracks how much of your eligible usage is utilizing those discounted rates. A higher percentage indicates you’ve locked in savings on steady-state workloads. It also flags if there’s room to increase savings by buying more commitments. For example, an organization can measure what portion of compute hours or cost is under reservations vs. on-demand ([6 FinOps KPIs and metrics to optimize cloud expenditures | TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tip/FinOps-KPIs-and-metrics-to-optimize-cloud-expenditures#:~:text=year%20or%20three)). **Managing commitment discounts is a top FinOps priority** (second only to waste reduction in 2024) ([Reducing Waste and Managing Commitments Top Key Priorities for FinOps Practitioners ](https://www.finops.org/insights/key-priorities-shift-in-2024/#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20time%2C%20Reducing,getting%20from%20their%20cloud%20investments)) ([Reducing Waste and Managing Commitments Top Key Priorities for FinOps Practitioners ](https://www.finops.org/insights/key-priorities-shift-in-2024/#:~:text=,based%20discounts%2C%20reflecting%20economic%20uncertainty)). Related sub-metrics include *commitment utilization* and *commitment waste*: FinOps teams often calculate the **percent of purchased commitments that went unused** (i.e. paid for but not actually consumed) ([Rate Optimization KPI: Percent of Commitment Discount Waste](https://www.finops.org/wg/percent-commitment-based-discount-waste-playbook/#:~:text=This%20playbook%20provides%20guidance%20on,to%20make%20informed%20business%20decisions)) – this “commitment waste” should be kept low by right-sizing commitments and sharing them across teams.

- **Cloud Spend Variance (Forecast Accuracy)** – The variance between projected or budgeted cloud spend and actual spend over a period ([6 FinOps KPIs and metrics to optimize cloud expenditures | TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tip/FinOps-KPIs-and-metrics-to-optimize-cloud-expenditures#:~:text=6)). This indicates how effective your forecasting and cost controls are. A small variance (actuals close to forecast) means good predictability; a large variance suggests surprises or poor insight into usage patterns. High overruns can signal inefficiencies or lack of cost governance. Many organizations use **budget vs. actual variance** as a KPI to drive better forecasting and proactive cost management ([6 FinOps KPIs and metrics to optimize cloud expenditures | TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tip/FinOps-KPIs-and-metrics-to-optimize-cloud-expenditures#:~:text=6)). Improving this metric helps avoid bill shock and ties into anomaly detection (addressed below). Notably, FinOps survey data shows forecasting is a higher concern for mid-size cloud spenders (it ranked #2 priority for smaller spend levels) and remains important across the board ([Reducing Waste and Managing Commitments Top Key Priorities for FinOps Practitioners ](https://www.finops.org/insights/key-priorities-shift-in-2024/#:~:text=When%20the%20data%20are%20split,it%20gets%20out%20of%20hand)).

These metrics together provide a balanced view of cost efficiency. In practice, **waste reduction and discount utilization often carry the greatest weight** because they directly yield cost savings ([Reducing Waste and Managing Commitments Top Key Priorities for FinOps Practitioners ](https://www.finops.org/insights/key-priorities-shift-in-2024/#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20time%2C%20Reducing,getting%20from%20their%20cloud%20investments)) ([Reducing Waste and Managing Commitments Top Key Priorities for FinOps Practitioners ](https://www.finops.org/insights/key-priorities-shift-in-2024/#:~:text=,based%20discounts%2C%20reflecting%20economic%20uncertainty)). Cost allocation underpins accountability (essential for enabling engineering owners to optimize), and unit cost trends ensure efficiency gains align with business value. Spend variance ties it all together by checking that no unexpected costs slip through. 

**Table: Example Weighting of Cost Efficiency Factors** – While exact weighting will vary by organization, a **composite FinOps score** might emphasize factors as follows (based on industry priorities):

| **Factor**                         | **Suggested Weight** |
|------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Eliminating Waste (Improving Utilization)    | 30% (High)   |
| Commitment Discount Coverage & Utilization  | 25% (High)   |
| Cost Allocation (Cost Accountability)       | 15% (Medium) |
| Unit Cost Efficiency (Output per $)         | 15% (Medium) |
| Forecast Accuracy (Spend vs Budget)         | 15% (Medium) |

*Rationale:* Waste elimination and reserved discount usage together could constitute ~50% of the score given their top priority status in FinOps programs ([Reducing Waste and Managing Commitments Top Key Priorities for FinOps Practitioners ](https://www.finops.org/insights/key-priorities-shift-in-2024/#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20time%2C%20Reducing,getting%20from%20their%20cloud%20investments)). The other half can be split among allocation (ensuring governance), unit economics (driving true efficiency), and forecasting accuracy (preventing surprises). This ensures the score isn’t just about cutting cost, but **efficient cloud value delivery**. Each organization may adjust weights (e.g. a business early in FinOps might prioritize allocation first, whereas a mature FinOps practice might put more weight on unit costs or sustainability). The above is an illustrative model – **the key is to include a mix of utilization, cost optimization, and alignment to business goals** in the scoring criteria ([Guidance for Cloud Financial Management on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/cloud-financial-management-on-aws/#:~:text=A%20good%20KPI%20measures%20efficiency,dollar%20spent%20for%20your%20organization)) ([Guidance for Cloud Financial Management on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/cloud-financial-management-on-aws/#:~:text=KPIs%20can%20be%20broken%20down,Month)).

## Cloud-Specific Criteria and Cloud-Agnostic Scoring

While the core metrics apply across all clouds, effective scoring should consider cloud-specific nuances. Each major cloud provider has unique cost constructs and best practices, which can be factored into a more tailored score. At the same time, a **cloud-agnostic FinOps score** ensures a unified view of efficiency regardless of provider. Below, we outline criteria specific to AWS, Azure, and GCP, followed by approaches to create a universal score.

### AWS-Specific Cost Efficiency Criteria  
**Amazon Web Services** offers many discount options and tools, and AWS users often focus on:  
- **Reserved Instances & Savings Plans Utilization** – AWS has Reserved Instances (for EC2, RDS, etc.) and Savings Plans (compute spend commitments) to reduce rates. A key AWS metric is the percentage of eligible workload covered by RIs/Savings Plans and how well those purchases are utilized. High RI/SP coverage and near-100% utilization of purchased commitments indicate cost efficiency. Unused RI hours or unused Savings Plan commitment represent **direct waste** (paid but not used). FinOps teams measure this as **“commitment discount waste”** ([Rate Optimization KPI: Percent of Commitment Discount Waste](https://www.finops.org/wg/percent-commitment-based-discount-waste-playbook/#:~:text=This%20playbook%20provides%20guidance%20on,to%20make%20informed%20business%20decisions)) and strive to keep it low via size flexibility, instance family flexibility and by sharing discounts across accounts. Managing these commitments is a top priority in FinOps (ranked alongside waste reduction) ([Reducing Waste and Managing Commitments Top Key Priorities for FinOps Practitioners ](https://www.finops.org/insights/key-priorities-shift-in-2024/#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20time%2C%20Reducing,getting%20from%20their%20cloud%20investments)).

- **Spot Instance Adoption** – AWS Spot instances offer deep discounts (up to ~90%) for spare capacity. Efficient AWS environments make use of Spot for fault-tolerant and flexible workloads. A high proportion of compute hours on Spot versus On-Demand can boost cost efficiency significantly. (Similarly, using AWS’s other discounted options like Compute Savings Plans or Spot for ECS/EKS can be scored positively.)

- **Right-Sizing and Elasticity** – AWS provides tools like **Compute Optimizer** and Trusted Advisor to recommend rightsizing EC2, EBS, etc. Incorporating a score for how many resources are at optimal sizing (or how many rightsizing recommendations have been acted on) can be useful. Also, AWS’s **auto-scaling and scheduling** capabilities allow turning off resources when not needed (for example, non-prod instances shut down on nights/weekends). Adherence to “turn it off when idle” practices (sometimes called **power scheduling adherence**) is a measurable factor (e.g. what percentage of dev servers are turned off during off hours). This directly reduces waste ([6 FinOps KPIs and metrics to optimize cloud expenditures | TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tip/FinOps-KPIs-and-metrics-to-optimize-cloud-expenditures#:~:text=While%20some%20cloud%20resources%20see,and%20claw%20back%20the%20savings)). 

- **Cost Management & Visibility** – Effective use of AWS-native cost management features can be part of AWS-specific scoring. This includes the use of **cost allocation tags on AWS** (and the percentage of spend that is tagged), configuring AWS Cost Categories, and using AWS Cost Explorer reports or AWS Budgets for visibility. AWS encourages timely cost visibility; a FinOps score might reward organizations that have set up **Budgets & Alerts** and regularly review AWS cost reports (indicating a proactive stance). AWS also has a **Cloud Financial Management (CFM) framework** in their Well-Architected toolkits which stresses these practices.

- **Unit Metrics and Efficiency Improvements** – AWS’s guidance suggests implementing **unit metrics** to measure efficiency (e.g. “cost per EC2 running hour” or business metrics like cost per order) ([Guidance for Cloud Financial Management on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/cloud-financial-management-on-aws/#:~:text=KPIs%20can%20be%20broken%20down,Month)) ([Guidance for Cloud Financial Management on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/cloud-financial-management-on-aws/#:~:text=Business%20metrics%20measure%20efficiency%20related,or%20cost%20per%20shipped%20product)). In an AWS context, one might track metrics such as “S3 storage cost per GB” or “Lambda cost per 1000 invocations” over time. A scoring model can give points for having such metrics defined and for improving them (e.g., reducing cost per transaction). The AWS perspective is that *“a good KPI measures output per unit of cost, not just cost alone”* ([Guidance for Cloud Financial Management on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/cloud-financial-management-on-aws/#:~:text=A%20good%20KPI%20measures%20efficiency,dollar%20spent%20for%20your%20organization)) – this aligns with advanced efficiency scoring.

**Example:** An AWS-focused FinOps scorecard might allocate, say, 30% of points to RI/Savings Plan coverage & utilization, 20% to eliminating idle resources (using Trusted Advisor reports on low utilization), 20% to cost allocation and tagging completeness, 15% to use of Spot & elasticity, and 15% to unit cost improvements and budgeting accuracy. (These are illustrative – actual weights should align to business priorities.) 

### Azure-Specific Cost Efficiency Criteria  
**Microsoft Azure** has its own set of cost optimization levers and principles:  
- **Azure Reservations & Hybrid Benefit** – Azure’s equivalent to commitments are **Reserved Instances (Reservations)** for services like VMs, SQL databases, etc., and the Azure Hybrid Benefit (which lets you use existing Windows Server/SQL Server licenses on Azure VMs for cost savings). A high-efficiency Azure environment will maximize the use of Reservations for steady workloads and apply Hybrid Benefit wherever applicable. Therefore, **Reservation coverage** (what percent of VM usage hours are under a reservation) and **reservation utilization** rates are key metrics. Similarly, tracking usage of Hybrid Benefit for eligible resources (especially in Windows environments) contributes to cost efficiency. Low utilization or not purchasing available reservations signals room for improvement.

- **Right-Sizing & Azure Advisor Recommendations** – Azure Advisor provides cost optimization recommendations (e.g. underutilized VM downsize, idle disk deletion). Following these recommendations can be measured. One could score based on the percentage of Azure Advisor cost recommendations that have been implemented, or the total potential savings still left on the table. Azure also offers **Auto-shutdown** for VMs and **automation scripts** to start/stop VMs on schedule; using these to eliminate idle time improves efficiency. Thus, metrics like **idle VM count** or **schedule adherence** (turning off VMs as scheduled) are pertinent in Azure.

- **Cost Management and Governance** – Azure has **Azure Cost Management + Billing** built-in, which includes budgeting, cost alerts, and cost allocation tools. Efficient Azure FinOps practices involve setting up **budgets with alerts**, using **resource tags** and Resource Groups for chargeback, and leveraging **Cost Management reports**. A scoring model for Azure could check if budgets are in place (and no frequent budget overruns), and if a high percentage of costs are tagged to business units. Additionally, Azure policies can enforce cost-saving configurations (e.g. restrict usage of expensive SKUs or ensure VMs are in approved sizes); using such governance features can be part of the criteria.

- **Azure-specific Services Efficiency** – Azure offers unique services like Azure Spot VMs (discounted VMs similar to AWS Spot), **Azure SQL tier tuning**, and various service-specific cost options (like Azure Storage access tiers, reserved capacity for Cosmos DB, etc.). A comprehensive Azure cost efficiency score may include whether the team is using **the optimal service tiers**. For instance, using Archive storage for cold data, using Spot VMs for batch jobs, or leveraging **Azure Monitor Autoscale** to scale down app services when load is low. Essentially, this falls under workload optimization specific to Azure’s offerings.

Azure’s well-architected **Cost Optimization design principles** emphasize understanding pricing metrics, right-sizing, eliminating waste, and using the correct resources for the job ([Cost Optimization design principles - Microsoft Azure Well ...](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/principles#:~:text=Cost%20Optimization%20design%20principles%20,can%20also%20prevent%20unwarranted)). Thus, an Azure FinOps score should reflect success in those areas. For example, using PaaS services in a cost-effective way (versus misusing more expensive IaaS), or consolidating workloads to use Azure’s discount entitlements effectively.

### GCP-Specific Cost Efficiency Criteria  
**Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** has some distinct cost features and recently introduced **FinOps tools** of its own:  
- **Committed Use Discounts (CUDs) & Sustained Use Discounts** – GCP offers automatic Sustained Use Discounts (SUD) for consistent VM usage and **Committed Use Discounts** for 1- or 3-year commitments on compute and RAM. A GCP cost efficiency score will heavily weigh **CUD coverage** (what percentage of eligible spend is covered by commitments) and **CUD utilization**. Since SUDs are automatic, the focus is ensuring workloads actually run continuously enough to earn them (or using smaller instance shapes if not fully utilized). Essentially, measure how well the environment leverages GCP’s discount programs. If many workloads are on-demand without CUDs and could be committed, that’s inefficiency. GCP also has **volume discounts** for some services and **sustained use** breaks, which should be accounted for in efficiency scoring.

- **Rightsizing and Idle Resource Removal** – Like other clouds, GCP provides recommendations (in the Recommender tool) for rightsizing VM instances, deleting idle persistent disks, releasing unused IPs, etc. An efficiency score for GCP can include the number of idle resources (e.g. unattached disks, idle CloudSQL instances) and whether they’re being addressed. GCP’s Recommender can even give an approximate savings amount; tracking the ratio of “realized savings vs. identified savings” could be a KPI. Also, GCP has **per-second billing** and very granular scaling – an efficient setup should take advantage of these by shutting things down promptly. 

- **Preemptible VM/Spot Usage** – GCP’s Preemptible VMs (now also Spot VMs) are low-cost compute options for transient workloads. Using Preemptibles for appropriate workloads is analogous to AWS Spot usage. A high percentage of Preemptible VM usage for batch or fault-tolerant jobs would improve a GCP efficiency score.

- **GCP FinOps Hub and Score** – Google has introduced a **FinOps Hub** in its Cloud Console, which includes a proprietary **FinOps Score**. According to Google, *“The FinOps Score is a composite score that evaluates your cloud financial management practices on Google Cloud”* ([Quadra - FinOps Hub: The Smart Way to Manage Your Google Cloud Costs.](https://www.quadrasystems.net/blogs/finops-hub-the-smart-way-to-manage-your-google-cloud-costs#:~:text=,of%20Cloud%20Cost%20Management%20Effectiveness)). It factors in **monitoring spend, optimizing resources, and purchasing CUDs** ([Quadra - FinOps Hub: The Smart Way to Manage Your Google Cloud Costs.](https://www.quadrasystems.net/blogs/finops-hub-the-smart-way-to-manage-your-google-cloud-costs#:~:text=,of%20Cloud%20Cost%20Management%20Effectiveness)) ([Quadra - FinOps Hub: The Smart Way to Manage Your Google Cloud Costs.](https://www.quadrasystems.net/blogs/finops-hub-the-smart-way-to-manage-your-google-cloud-costs#:~:text=,in%20Google%20Cloud%27s%20recommended%20CUDs)). Specifically, it looks at whether you are **consistently monitoring costs**, **turning off idle resources and rightsizing**, and **utilizing recommended CUDs** ([Quadra - FinOps Hub: The Smart Way to Manage Your Google Cloud Costs.](https://www.quadrasystems.net/blogs/finops-hub-the-smart-way-to-manage-your-google-cloud-costs#:~:text=,in%20Google%20Cloud%27s%20recommended%20CUDs)). This aligns closely with the criteria above. In essence, Google’s score rewards:
  - Use of budgeting and cost monitoring tools (visibility).
  - Active optimization of resources (no idle, right-size).
  - Usage of committed discounts.
  
  GCP’s FinOps Score can serve as a model for weighting: if an organization is fully using GCP’s built-in metrics, the FinOps CLI could mirror those factors for cross-cloud scoring as well. A GCP-specific scoring might additionally consider **BigQuery cost optimization** (like using clustered tables, etc.) or **cost-aware development** (e.g., avoiding egress by co-locating services).

- **Service-specific optimizations** – GCP has unique services (BigQuery, Cloud Storage classes, etc.) that have their own cost levers. For example, efficient use of BigQuery might involve partitioning data and using reservations for BigQuery slots. A granular GCP score could give points for using such optimizations (though these may be too detailed for a high-level score). In general, sticking to **GCP best practices** (like those in Google’s Cloud Architecture Framework for cost optimization) would yield a higher efficiency score.

In summary, AWS, Azure, and GCP each require tracking how well you use *their* discount vehicles and optimization tools:
**AWS** – RI/Savings Plan utilization, Spot, tagging, rightsizing;  
**Azure** – Reservations/Hybrid Benefit, scheduling off, Azure Advisor compliance;  
**GCP** – CUDs/SUDs usage, Preemptibles, acting on Recommender, plus the built-in FinOps score factors.

However, to avoid silos, the **FinOps CLI should present a unified (cloud-agnostic) cost efficiency score** as well. This is where the *FOCUS* framework and cross-cloud metrics come in.

### Universal FinOps Scoring (Cloud-Agnostic Model)  
A cloud-agnostic scoring model means you can evaluate cost efficiency in a **consistent way across AWS, Azure, and GCP** (and any other providers). To achieve this, the FinOps CLI can leverage common denominators in cloud cost management, normalizing the data and metrics:

- **Use of FOCUS (FinOps Open Cost and Usage Specification)** – The FinOps Foundation’s FOCUS™ is an open specification to **normalize cost and usage data across cloud vendors** ([Adopting FOCUS™, the FinOps Open Cost and Usage Specification](https://www.finops.org/wg/adopting-focus-the-finops-open-cost-and-usage-specification/#:~:text=Multi,of%20inaccurate%20reporting%20due%20to)). By adopting FOCUS, an organization can aggregate multi-cloud billing data into one schema. This enables consistent reporting and analytics across clouds (e.g., one column for “Service” or “Usage Amount” that aligns AWS, Azure, GCP data). For scoring, this means metrics like “% idle resource spend” or “unit cost per request” can be calculated uniformly, regardless of cloud. *FOCUS “enables consistent reporting across vendors through data normalization, letting leadership analyze the whole environment instead of siloed by cloud”* ([Adopting FOCUS™, the FinOps Open Cost and Usage Specification](https://www.finops.org/wg/adopting-focus-the-finops-open-cost-and-usage-specification/#:~:text=Multi,of%20inaccurate%20reporting%20due%20to)). FinOps CLI should define each metric in a cloud-agnostic way (possibly using FOCUS fields) so that, for example, **Resource Utilization Rate** or **Cost per Customer** is computed the same way for all providers.

- **Common Metrics Across Clouds** – As outlined in the Key Metrics section, KPIs such as utilization, waste, allocation, unit costs, etc., are **cloud-agnostic by nature**. A universal score would be built from those metrics without tying them to a specific vendor’s terminology. For instance, **“Discount coverage”** exists on all clouds (AWS RI/SP, Azure Reservations, GCP CUDs) – the score can measure how much of total spend is at discounted rates versus on-demand across all cloud spend. **“Idle resources”** exist everywhere – the score can aggregate waste from AWS (idle EC2, EBS), Azure (idle VMs, disks), and GCP (idle GCE, PD) together to calculate a total waste percentage. By defining each factor broadly (e.g. “commitment usage %” and mapping that to AWS RI+SP, Azure Res, GCP CUD), the FinOps score becomes provider-agnostic.

- **Aggregation and Weighting** – A universal FinOps score might sum up sub-scores from each cloud (weighted by spend or number of resources) or evaluate the whole environment as one dataset. The latter is preferable for a *single pane* metric. For example, one could compute overall utilization rate = (total cloud usage units / total provisioned capacity units) across all providers, then score that. Similarly, overall tagging coverage = (tagged cost / total cost) across all clouds. Each metric can be given a weight (see the example table above) to compute a single score. This lets an organization compare business units or applications in a multi-cloud environment on equal footing.

- **Ensure Flexibility** – Different clouds have unique services (like GCP BigQuery or AWS Redshift). A truly agnostic model focuses on the fundamentals common to all. However, the model can be extensible: if a team only uses AWS and GCP, the score could exclude Azure-specific criteria. The key is that the **scoring framework remains consistent**. Many FinOps KPIs are explicitly designed to be cloud-neutral – the FinOps Foundation’s KPI catalog is for “all organizations, regardless of cloud provider” ([FinOps KPIs ](https://www.finops.org/wg/finops-kpis/?prod_kpis%5Bpage%5D=2#:~:text=complexity,industry%2C%20size%2C%20or%20FinOps%20maturity)). Metrics like *unallocated cost, forecast variance, utilization, waste percent, budget adherence, etc.* apply universally ([FinOps KPIs](https://www.finops.org/wg/finops-kpis/#:~:text=FinOps%20KPIs%20include%20unpredicted%20spend,resource%20utilization%2C%20and%20unallocated%20costs)). The FinOps CLI can implement these with data from any source.

- **Composite Score Calculation** – In practice, the FinOps CLI might calculate a score out of 100 (or a grade A-F) for the enterprise or per project/team. For example, Google’s FinOps Score in their cloud console likely uses a formula combining the factors they list ([Quadra - FinOps Hub: The Smart Way to Manage Your Google Cloud Costs.](https://www.quadrasystems.net/blogs/finops-hub-the-smart-way-to-manage-your-google-cloud-costs#:~:text=,of%20Cloud%20Cost%20Management%20Effectiveness)). The CLI could do similarly: e.g., assign points for >80% RI/CUD coverage, >70% resource utilization, <5% unallocated spend, no big forecast misses, etc. and combine them. It’s wise to **calibrate the score against benchmarks** – perhaps using industry data (more on benchmarks in the next section) to set what “good” looks like. For instance, if average waste is 30%, maybe 10% waste gets full points. If industry average RI coverage is say 50%, then 80%+ might be full points.

In summary, **cloud-agnostic scoring requires a normalized dataset and a unified set of metrics.** FinOps teams are increasingly adopting practices to compare efficiency across multi-cloud – FOCUS is one enabler ([Adopting FOCUS™, the FinOps Open Cost and Usage Specification](https://www.finops.org/wg/adopting-focus-the-finops-open-cost-and-usage-specification/#:~:text=Multi,of%20inaccurate%20reporting%20due%20to)). A universal FinOps score should highlight *overall* financial optimization posture, while allowing drill-down into each cloud’s contributions. Use the common KPIs as pillars, and incorporate each cloud’s specifics as sub-metrics feeding those pillars. The result is a single cost efficiency score that’s comparable across teams and over time, without being skewed by which cloud they use.

## Advanced Considerations for Cost Efficiency Scoring  
Beyond the basic metrics, a robust cost efficiency score (and FinOps practice) should account for advanced factors that influence cloud cost management. These include how well you detect anomalies, leverage pricing commitments, and even how you consider sustainability. Industry benchmarks and standard methodologies also guide what “good” looks like. Below are key advanced considerations and best practices:

### Anomaly Detection and Response  
**Cost anomaly detection** is crucial for preventing cost overruns and spotting inefficiencies early. A FinOps score can incorporate whether an organization has processes to catch and handle anomalies. Best practices include: 

- **Automated Anomaly Detection Tools** – Using cloud-native or third-party tools to monitor spend in near real-time. AWS offers Cost Anomaly Detection, Azure has cost anomaly features (e.g. in Cost Management or via Azure Advisor), and GCP has anomaly detection in its Recommender/Cloud Monitoring. Mature FinOps teams implement these and tune them. As FinOps Foundation guidance notes, *“cost anomaly detection focuses on identifying deviations from an expected rate of spend”* ([Managing Cloud Cost Anomalies](https://www.finops.org/wg/managing-cloud-cost-anomalies/#:~:text=Cost%20anomaly%20detection%20focuses%20on,acceptable%20level%20of%20false%20positives)), typically looking for unexpected **spikes in cost** rather than decreases. An efficient practice is to run anomaly checks daily or hourly, not just wait for end-of-month surprises ([Managing Cloud Cost Anomalies](https://www.finops.org/wg/managing-cloud-cost-anomalies/#:~:text=This%20is%20where%20the%20Anomaly,process%20separates%20itself%20from%20budgets)). 

- **Anomaly Types** – FinOps experts categorize anomalies such as: **(1)** sudden spikes in **total cost** for a service or account, **(2)** spikes in **unit cost (cost per usage)**, and **(3)** drops in **business value metrics relative to cost** ([Managing Cloud Cost Anomalies](https://www.finops.org/wg/managing-cloud-cost-anomalies/#:~:text=1,can%20be%20broken%20down%20by)). For example, a spike in cost per compute hour might mean a workload shifted from reserved capacity to on-demand unexpectedly (raising unit cost). A drop in revenue-to-cost ratio can flag efficiency loss ([Managing Cloud Cost Anomalies](https://www.finops.org/wg/managing-cloud-cost-anomalies/#:~:text=2,player%20for%20a%20gaming%20company)). Scoring could reward teams that monitor all these anomaly types, not just total spend. Advanced anomaly detection uses historical data and forecasts to set expected ranges ([Managing Cloud Cost Anomalies](https://www.finops.org/wg/managing-cloud-cost-anomalies/#:~:text=Most%20anomaly%20detection%20systems%20utilize,from%20historical%20data%20and%20lack)) ([Managing Cloud Cost Anomalies](https://www.finops.org/wg/managing-cloud-cost-anomalies/#:~:text=Most%20anomaly%20detection%20systems%20utilize,aware%20is%20more%20false%20positives)); employing such models (possibly ML-based detection) indicates a higher FinOps maturity.

- **Response Process** – It’s not just detection, but how quickly and effectively teams respond. Best practice is to have an **anomaly response playbook**: when an alert triggers, relevant engineers or owners are notified, root cause is identified (e.g., a rogue deployment or an autoscaling config error), and corrective action is taken promptly. Some organizations set thresholds of severity (low/medium/high) based on anomaly size and have SLA for response ([Managing Cloud Cost Anomalies](https://www.finops.org/wg/managing-cloud-cost-anomalies/#:~:text=)) ([Managing Cloud Cost Anomalies](https://www.finops.org/wg/managing-cloud-cost-anomalies/#:~:text=with%20your%20budget%20for%20cost,granular%20ways%20such%20as%20tagging)). An aspect of scoring could be *time to resolve anomalies* or simply having a defined process in place. Since anomaly management is part of the FinOps **“Operate”** phase (continuous improvement), a fully cost-efficient operation will minimize unaddressed or prolonged anomalies.

- **Budget vs. Actual Monitoring** – While budgets alone might catch monthly overruns, anomaly detection catches **intra-period spikes** ([Managing Cloud Cost Anomalies](https://www.finops.org/wg/managing-cloud-cost-anomalies/#:~:text=This%20is%20where%20the%20Anomaly,process%20separates%20itself%20from%20budgets)). FinOps recommends using anomalies for day-to-day control, complementing budgeting which is more periodic ([Managing Cloud Cost Anomalies](https://www.finops.org/wg/managing-cloud-cost-anomalies/#:~:text=This%20is%20where%20the%20Anomaly,process%20separates%20itself%20from%20budgets)). A good practice is **linking anomalies to forecasting** – if an anomaly causes a permanent spend increase, forecasts should be adjusted. FinOps guidance suggests feeding anomalies back into re-forecasting so that future predictions improve ([Managing Cloud Cost Anomalies](https://www.finops.org/wg/managing-cloud-cost-anomalies/#:~:text=match%20at%20L313%20collecting%20all,for%20in%20the%20financial%20model)). Scoring could acknowledge integration between anomaly systems and forecasting accuracy.

In summary, **organizations with strong anomaly detection and response will avoid large unexpected costs**, contributing to better overall efficiency. A FinOps score can incorporate a qualitative element here (e.g., full points if anomaly process in place and recent incidents resolved) or quantitative (e.g., fewer than X anomalies over threshold per quarter, or no unaddressed high-severity anomalies). The goal is to encourage proactive cost governance – catching cost spikes (or dips that might indicate problems) as a normal practice of cloud operations.

### Commitment-Based Discounts and Rate Optimization  
We touched on commitment discount coverage above, but in advanced FinOps, **rate optimization** is a discipline of its own. This involves not only buying the right discounted offerings, but managing and monitoring them continuously:

- **Maximizing Commitment Utilization** – It’s not enough to purchase RIs or CUDs; you must use them fully. FinOps teams often track metrics like **Reserved Instance Utilization Rate** (the percentage of purchased RI hours that are applied to running instances) and **Coverage** (what % of running instance hours are covered by RIs). Unused reservations or commitments are essentially dollars wasted. The FinOps Foundation provides a formula for **“Percent of Commitment Discount Waste”** = (cost of unused commitment / total cost of commitment) * 100 ([Rate Optimization KPI: Percent of Commitment Discount Waste](https://www.finops.org/wg/percent-commitment-based-discount-waste-playbook/#:~:text=Formula)). An efficient cloud environment strives for a low percentage here (ideally zero unused commitments). If a company has 100 VM reservations and 5% go unused, that 5% is commitment waste to minimize ([Rate Optimization KPI: Percent of Commitment Discount Waste](https://www.finops.org/wg/percent-commitment-based-discount-waste-playbook/#:~:text=This%20playbook%20provides%20guidance%20on,to%20make%20informed%20business%20decisions)). Scoring-wise, one could deduct points for high commitment waste or reward near-full utilization.

- **Purchasing Strategy** – Sophisticated FinOps involves choosing the right mix of discount instruments: e.g., AWS Savings Plans vs RIs, 1-year vs 3-year terms, convertible vs standard RIs, Azure on-demand vs reserved vs spot, GCP CUDs vs just relying on SUDs. A best practice is to continuously evaluate commitment purchases against actual usage patterns. For instance, **AWS Cost Explorer and Azure Advisor give recommendations on buying RIs** if they detect steady usage. Organizations that act on these recommendations in a timely manner achieve better savings. The FinOps CLI score might incorporate if the organization has *any significant steady usage left on on-demand rates*. If yes, that’s potential savings left untapped (i.e., a lower score until addressed).

- **Sharing and Optimization** – In larger orgs, commitments can often be shared or pooled (e.g., AWS RIs can be shared across accounts in an organization, and savings plans cover multiple services; GCP allows project-level commitments but flexible apportioning via billing accounts). Best practice is to **centralize or at least coordinate commitment purchases** to avoid siloed inefficiencies ([#05. Should you Always Share Your Commitment Base Discounts?](https://www.recfo.blog/blog/should-you-always-share-your-commitment-base-discounts#:~:text=,maximize%20savings%20through%20higher%20utilization)). If one team has excess reserved capacity and another is paying on-demand, that’s a missed opportunity. FinOps practitioners recommend managing commitments at an enterprise level for higher utilization ([#05. Should you Always Share Your Commitment Base Discounts?](https://www.recfo.blog/blog/should-you-always-share-your-commitment-base-discounts#:~:text=,maximize%20savings%20through%20higher%20utilization)). A scoring model could give higher points if an organization has governance for **enterprise commitment management** (like a FinOps team overseeing all reservations and optimizing their distribution).

- **Rate Optimization beyond RIs** – This includes using spot instances, leveraging free-tier or credits efficiently, and choosing cheaper regions or instance families where possible. For example, AWS has **Graviton instances** that are cheaper per performance; GCP has **Tau T2D instances** which are cost-optimized. Using the most cost-efficient resource type for a workload is part of rate optimization. Another aspect: scheduling workloads to take advantage of pricing differences (like running batch jobs when spot prices are low). These are advanced tactics that only mature FinOps teams do, but they can further improve a cost efficiency score. *Any methodology that results in paying a lower unit price for the same usage is rate optimization.* This might be hard to measure directly, but proxies are: high spot usage, coverage by discounts, etc., which we already capture.

In short, **commitment-based discounts offer the largest potential savings, but only if managed well** ([Cloud Journey — Part 10 | FinOps - Chris Shayan](https://christophershayan.medium.com/cloud-journey-part-10-finops-fe545344d365#:~:text=Shayan%20christophershayan,apply%20to%20the%20largest)). The industry standard is to regularly monitor commitment utilization and adjust purchases accordingly (for instance, AWS and Azure allow selling or exchanging some commitments, and GCP allows increasing commitments). A well-run FinOps practice will ensure **most stable workloads are on discounted rates** and that **commitment waste is minimized** ([Rate Optimization KPI: Percent of Commitment Discount Waste](https://www.finops.org/wg/percent-commitment-based-discount-waste-playbook/#:~:text=This%20playbook%20provides%20guidance%20on,to%20make%20informed%20business%20decisions)). These practices should heavily influence the efficiency score – reflecting not just raw coverage, but the effectiveness of using what was bought.

### Sustainability and Cloud Efficiency  
An emerging aspect of FinOps is **cloud sustainability** – optimizing for environmental impact alongside cost. While sustainability metrics (like carbon emissions) are not yet as commonly tracked as cost, there’s growing recognition that **cost-efficient cloud usage often aligns with lower carbon footprint** ([Cloud Sustainability FinOps Framework Capability](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/cloud-sustainability/#:~:text=FinOps%20team%20and%20other%20Personas,whether%20financial%2C%20environmental%2C%20or%20operational)). Some considerations for integrating sustainability into cost efficiency scoring:

- **Carbon Footprint Metrics** – Cloud providers now offer tools to measure carbon emissions from cloud usage (e.g., AWS Customer Carbon Footprint Tool, Azure Sustainability Calculator, Google Cloud Carbon Footprint). A FinOps scorecard might include a **sustainability KPI** such as carbon emissions per user or per cloud spend. However, direct carbon tracking is in early stages for many – FinOps Foundation data shows fewer than 20% of FinOps teams currently work with sustainability teams ([The State of FinOps](https://data.finops.org/#:~:text=The%20State%20of%20FinOps%20Globally%2C,responsibility%20of%20cloud%20sustainability)). So a more accessible approach is to use **proxy metrics** for sustainability.

- **Efficiency as a Proxy for Sustainability** – Generally, **“using only what you need”** is both cost-efficient and eco-efficient. FinOps’s Cloud Sustainability guidance notes that efforts in **Workload Optimization (rightsizing, eliminating waste)** usually *“correlate closely with lower carbon emissions by only using what is needed, when it is needed (turn the lights off when not in use, use the correct size tool for the job)”* ([Cloud Sustainability FinOps Framework Capability](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/cloud-sustainability/#:~:text=FinOps%20team%20and%20other%20Personas,whether%20financial%2C%20environmental%2C%20or%20operational)). Therefore, the same metrics of utilization and waste serve as proxies for environmental efficiency. A high utilization/low waste environment not only saves money but also consumes less energy (hence lower emissions). The score can simply reflect that – an organization with a high efficiency score likely has a relatively low cloud carbon footprint for its scale.

- **Sustainability-Specific Actions** – Some organizations take additional steps like choosing greener regions (cloud regions with higher renewable energy usage) or using services designed for efficiency. For example, AWS’s Graviton processors are not only cost-effective but also energy efficient; Google Cloud’s data centers are very efficient and carbon-neutral energy matched. While the FinOps CLI scoring might not detail region selection or hardware choice, it could include a checkbox for whether sustainability is considered in architecture decisions. At a minimum, FinOps teams should be aware of the carbon impact of waste: e.g., dollars wasted equate to carbon wasted. FinOps and Sustainability teams can collaborate to optimize both cost and carbon ([FinOps and Sustainability Teams Collaborate to Optimize Carbon](https://www.finops.org/insights/finops-sustainability-collaborate/#:~:text=FinOps%20and%20Sustainability%20Teams%20Collaborate,manage%20IT%20usage%20optimization%20efforts)).

- **Showback of Efficiency Metrics** – A best practice is to show teams their **resource efficiency and carbon impact together**. AWS suggests using *“sustainability proxy metrics”* – e.g., track CPU hours, memory usage, and so on as a proxy for energy ([Measure and track cloud efficiency with sustainability proxy metrics, Part II: Establish a metrics pipeline | AWS Cloud Financial Management](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cloud-financial-management/measure-and-track-cloud-efficiency-with-sustainability-proxy-metrics-part-ii-establish-a-metrics-pipeline/#:~:text=This%20blog%20post%20series%20provides,metrics%20to%20optimize%20for%20sustainability)). By normalizing usage by business metrics, teams can see trends in efficiency over time ([Measure and track cloud efficiency with sustainability proxy metrics, Part I: What are proxy metrics? | AWS Cloud Financial Management](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cloud-financial-management/measure-and-track-cloud-efficiency-with-sustainability-proxy-metrics-part-i-what-are-proxy-metrics/#:~:text=metrics%20in%20your%20KPIs%20helps,read%20this)). For instance, AWS mentions calculating ratios like *“Graviton vCPU hours divided by total vCPU hours”* if the goal is to increase use of energy-efficient Graviton instances ([Measure and track cloud efficiency with sustainability proxy metrics, Part I: What are proxy metrics? | AWS Cloud Financial Management](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cloud-financial-management/measure-and-track-cloud-efficiency-with-sustainability-proxy-metrics-part-i-what-are-proxy-metrics/#:~:text=,Graviton%20vCPU%20hours%20divided%20by)). These kind of metrics could be part of an advanced score (for AWS specifically, but analogous ideas for others) – essentially checking if teams are adopting efficiency improvements (which save cost and carbon). Another example: **power usage effectiveness** for on-prem vs cloud migrations, but that’s outside scope. 

In conclusion, incorporating sustainability into cost efficiency scoring is mostly about reinforcing the same behaviors: **reduce waste, optimize usage, and choose efficient options**. FinOps’s stance is that financial and environmental goals should align, using data to drive both ([Cloud Sustainability FinOps Framework Capability](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/cloud-sustainability/#:~:text=Cloud%20Sustainability%20defines%20how%20the,deploying%20workloads%20in%20the%20cloud)) ([Cloud Sustainability FinOps Framework Capability](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/cloud-sustainability/#:~:text=FinOps%20teams%20should%20be%20integrating,can%20be%20evaluated%20by%20the)). So, the FinOps CLI could optionally report a “sustainability sub-score” or at least highlight metrics like “idle hours = X (equating to Y kg CO2)”. Industry recommendations are to start including these considerations now, as regulations are emerging that require reporting on IT carbon emissions ([Cloud Sustainability FinOps Framework Capability](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/cloud-sustainability/#:~:text=depending%20on%20all%20of%20its,and%20other%20important%20IT%20functions)). Therefore, the **best practice** is to integrate sustainability metrics in your FinOps dashboards, which the scoring criteria can encourage.

### Industry Benchmarks and Standard Methodologies  
To give context to the scoring criteria, it’s useful to know typical benchmarks (what other companies achieve or aim for) and to follow established methodologies:

- **Industry Benchmarks for Metrics**:
  - *Cloud Waste:* As noted, ~30% waste is common on average ([6 FinOps KPIs and metrics to optimize cloud expenditures | TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tip/FinOps-KPIs-and-metrics-to-optimize-cloud-expenditures#:~:text=claw%20back%20the%20savings)). Top performers drive this much lower. Many FinOps experts cite single-digit waste as an ultimate goal, though realistic targets might be, say, <10-15% waste for a well-optimized org. The FinOps Foundation’s *State of FinOps* reports consistently show waste reduction is a major area of focus. So if your waste % is around 30%, you’re average; if you get it to 15%, that’s comparatively efficient.
  - *Commitment Coverage:* It varies by org, but a rough benchmark: companies often target covering 70-80% of their steady-state compute with reservations/committed contracts ([6 FinOps KPIs and metrics to optimize cloud expenditures | TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tip/FinOps-KPIs-and-metrics-to-optimize-cloud-expenditures#:~:text=year%20or%20three)). You wouldn’t cover 100% (to retain some flexibility), but if you’re only at 20%, you’re below par. So scoring can normalize to something like 75% coverage as full points (adjusted per business tolerance for risk).
  - *Cost Allocation:* Many organizations struggle to ever allocate 100% of cost, especially at massive scale. But a common benchmark is to get to **95%+ of costs allocated** (meaning <5% is “unallocated” or in shared buckets) ([6 FinOps KPIs and metrics to optimize cloud expenditures | TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tip/FinOps-KPIs-and-metrics-to-optimize-cloud-expenditures#:~:text=identify%20cost%20centers%20and%20assign,costs)). High spend, mature FinOps shops put emphasis on this (in 2024 data, companies >\$100M cloud spend had “full allocation of spending” as their #3 priority) ([Reducing Waste and Managing Commitments Top Key Priorities for FinOps Practitioners ](https://www.finops.org/insights/key-priorities-shift-in-2024/#:~:text=the%20second%20highest%20priorities,it%20gets%20out%20of%20hand)). So anything under, say, 80% allocation would be poor, whereas 95%+ is best-in-class.
  - *Forecast Accuracy:* A widely cited target is to keep cloud spending within +/- 5% of forecast on a monthly or quarterly basis (though this can be tough in dynamic environments). More broadly, the goal is to **avoid budget overruns** – given 72% of cloud decision-makers reported overruns in a survey ([6 FinOps KPIs and metrics to optimize cloud expenditures | TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tip/FinOps-KPIs-and-metrics-to-optimize-cloud-expenditures#:~:text=big%20difference%20suggests%20there%20is,report%2C%20which%20polled%20420%20respondents)), just hitting your budget is already an achievement. So a benchmark could be: within 5% = excellent, 10% = good, beyond 10% variance = needs improvement.
  - *Unit Cost Trends:* If you measure cost per customer or per transaction, the expectation is that over time this either decreases or stays flat while usage grows. A practical benchmark is simply **year-over-year reduction in unit cost** (e.g., “we delivered compute 10% cheaper per operation than last year”). Many FinOps practitioners use **unit economics improvement as a sign of cloud efficiency** – e.g., teams like to tout how cost per user fell even as total users rose, showing economies of scale ([Guidance for Cloud Financial Management on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/cloud-financial-management-on-aws/#:~:text=Efficient%20KPIs%20measure%20how%20much,dollar%20spent%20for%20your%20organization)) ([Guidance for Cloud Financial Management on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/cloud-financial-management-on-aws/#:~:text=measuring%20cost%20per%20resource%20used,Month)).
  
  These benchmarks can guide the scoring thresholds. The FinOps Foundation’s community provides ranges for some KPIs (for example, they might share that a typical cost allocation rate is X%). If available, aligning score calibration to those ranges makes the score meaningful relative to peers.

- **FinOps Framework Methodologies:** The FinOps Foundation promotes a **framework with Phases (Inform, Optimize, Operate)** and **Capabilities** (like Cost Allocation, Budgeting, Forecasting, Optimization, etc.). A cost efficiency score should encourage progression in all these areas:
  - In **Inform** phase, you focus on visibility: tagging, allocation, benchmarking, unit costs. 
  - In **Optimize**, you execute optimizations: rightsizing, terminating waste, buying RIs/CUDs, etc. 
  - In **Operate**, you implement processes: anomaly response, continuous improvement, empowering engineers with cost data.
  
  A balanced score touches each phase. For example, a company just starting FinOps might score lower on Optimize (lots of waste) but can improve that over time. The **FinOps Maturity Model** and **FinOps Assessment** tools from the Foundation provide qualitative measures of capability maturity ([Optimize Your Cloud Spend with a FinOps Maturity Assessment](https://www.globaldots.com/resources/blog/optimizing-cloud-spend-through-finops-maturity-assessment/#:~:text=Optimize%20Your%20Cloud%20Spend%20with,phases%3A%20crawl%2C%20walk%2C%20or%20run)). While our scoring is quantitative, it’s aligned with those: e.g., a “crawl” stage company might only track total spend (no unit metrics, no automation), whereas a “run” stage company tracks granular KPIs and automates optimization. Thus, the scoring criteria double as a roadmap for maturity – start with getting visibility (tags, allocation), then move to optimizing waste and rates, then refine with unit economics and automation. Each level achieved boosts the score.

- **Standard Cost Optimization Techniques**: Any scoring system should reinforce known best practices. These include:
  - **Rightsizing & Refactoring** (use appropriate resources, scale down where possible),
  - **Schedule Resources** (turn off dev/test when not in use),
  - **Optimize Storage Costs** (delete old snapshots, move infrequently used data to cheaper storage classes),
  - **Use Managed Services and Serverless wisely** (sometimes switching to a fully managed service can save cost, though not always – needs evaluation),
  - **Governance** (set guardrails so new projects follow tagging and cost-efficient instance choices by default).
  
  Cloud providers and FinOps experts often publish checklists of such techniques. For instance, AWS Well-Architected Cost Optimization pillar lists things like measuring **Cost per Business Outcome**, using **Cost-Aware Architecture**, and continual improvement. Azure and GCP have similar guides. Ensuring the FinOps CLI score considers these (either directly as metrics or indirectly through the outcomes they drive) will make it comprehensive. For example, if an org has lots of unattached volumes, it hits the waste metric; if they haven’t adopted any reserved capacity, it hits the discount metric; if they haven’t tagged, it hits allocation metric, and so on – thereby naturally incorporating all standard practices through the scoring penalties.

- **Benchmarking Against Peers:** The FinOps Foundation encourages benchmarking (they even have a working group on this ([FinOps KPIs ](https://www.finops.org/wg/finops-kpis/?prod_kpis%5Bpage%5D=2#:~:text=))). A FinOps CLI might in the future allow companies to compare scores anonymously. In absence of that, using the **State of FinOps Reports** as a benchmark is useful – e.g., knowing that *50% of FinOps teams cite cutting idle resources as top objective* ([6 FinOps KPIs and metrics to optimize cloud expenditures | TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tip/FinOps-KPIs-and-metrics-to-optimize-cloud-expenditures#:~:text=Enterprises%20waste%20nearly%2030,resources%20as%20their%20top%20objective)) tells you that if your environment still has a lot of idle waste, you’re behind the curve. Likewise, if your commitment usage is low, note that industry trend shows heavy focus on improving that in 2024 ([Reducing Waste and Managing Commitments Top Key Priorities for FinOps Practitioners ](https://www.finops.org/insights/key-priorities-shift-in-2024/#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20time%2C%20Reducing,getting%20from%20their%20cloud%20investments)). So aligning scoring criteria with what industry surveys identify as priorities (waste, commitments, forecast, allocation) ensures the score reflects what’s considered FinOps “good practice” broadly.

In conclusion, **the cost efficiency scoring standards** for a FinOps CLI should combine fundamental KPIs with provider-specific insights, all guided by best practices and benchmarks from the FinOps community. A structured model might include: core metrics (utilization, waste %, allocation %, unit cost, coverage of discounts, forecast accuracy), each possibly broken down by cloud, and then aggregated to a unified FinOps score. Weightings can be applied to emphasize the most critical factors (with waste and discount usage usually top-ranked, followed by allocation and unit cost efficiency) ([Reducing Waste and Managing Commitments Top Key Priorities for FinOps Practitioners ](https://www.finops.org/insights/key-priorities-shift-in-2024/#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20time%2C%20Reducing,getting%20from%20their%20cloud%20investments)) ([Reducing Waste and Managing Commitments Top Key Priorities for FinOps Practitioners ](https://www.finops.org/insights/key-priorities-shift-in-2024/#:~:text=When%20the%20data%20are%20split,it%20gets%20out%20of%20hand)). Additionally, advanced capabilities like anomaly management and sustainability considerations distinguish a *basic* cost management program from a truly *efficient and optimized* FinOps practice. By following frameworks like FOCUS for data and the FinOps Principles and Capabilities for process, the FinOps CLI can deliver a scoring model that is **both cloud-agnostic and comprehensive**, helping organizations measure and improve their cloud cost efficiency in line with industry standards.
