# Case Studies & Real-World Applications

## Case Study 1: SaaS Company with Multi-Cloud Deployments

### Company Profile
- Uses AWS for production, GCP for specific services, and a smaller footprint in Azure.
- FinOps team manually compiles cost data using each cloudâ€™s native tools.

### Challenges
- Manual consolidation of cost data into spreadsheets.
- Inconsistent tagging leading to unallocated costs.
- Lack of real-time anomaly detection (e.g., costly misconfigured instances).

### How the Library Helps
- **Automated Reporting:** Daily script aggregates multi-cloud cost data and sends summary reports.
- **Tagging Analysis:** Identifies untagged resources, driving improved tagging practices.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Flags unexpected cost spikes, enabling prompt remediation.
- **Forecasting:** Provides projections to aid in budgeting and financial planning.

## Case Study 2: Enterprise with Cloud Cost Governance Mandate

### Company Profile
- Large enterprise with AWS, Azure, and GCP deployments.
- Strict internal policies for tagging, budgets, and cost governance.
- Currently uses a commercial FinOps platform that is expensive and not fully customizable.

### Challenges
- Disparate native tools and high licensing costs.
- Inability to fully customize cost allocation and governance.
- Reliance on manual scripts for automation.

### How the Library Helps
- **Unified Multi-Cloud View:** Consolidates cost data in-house for better data control.
- **Customization:** Allows integration with internal tagging taxonomies and business mappings.
- **Automation Hooks:** Future policy enforcement to automatically remediate cost issues.
- **Cost Savings:** Reduces reliance on expensive commercial tools while improving real-time visibility.

## Real-World Insights

- **Fragmented Tools:** Many companies use a mix of native dashboards and custom spreadsheets.
- **Desire for Automation:** There is a growing need for real-time anomaly alerts and automated cost optimization.
- **FinOps Maturity:** Organizations that adopt such tooling see better cost control and drive a cultural shift toward accountability.
